## ðŸ”§ System Architecture

```
Frontend (React + Vite)           Socket Server (Express + Socket.IO)    Backend (Directus + MySQL)
â”œâ”€â”€ useSocketNotifications        â”œâ”€â”€ Port 4010                          â”œâ”€â”€ Custom Hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ useNotificationStore          â”œâ”€â”€ Room management                    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ invitations.items.create
â”œâ”€â”€ NotificationsDropdown         â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user:email                    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ invitations.items.update
â””â”€â”€ WorkspaceConfigModal          â”‚   â””â”€â”€ workspace:id                  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ invitations.items.delete
                                  â””â”€â”€ POST /emit endpoint                â””â”€â”€ Custom Endpoints
                                                                            â”œâ”€â”€ /endpoint-invitations
                                                                            â””â”€â”€ /endpoint-workspaces
```

## ðŸ“¡ Socket Events Flow

### 1. **Invitation Created**

- `new-invitation` â†’ Toast notification for invited user
- `invitation-created` â†’ Updates workspace config modal

### 2. **Invitation Updated**

- `invitation-updated` â†’ Updates notification store and workspace lists
- Handles acceptance, rejection, and viewed status changes

### 3. **Invitation Deleted**

- `invitation-deleted` â†’ Removes from all UI components

### 4. **Workspace Member Events**

- `workspace-member-added` â†’ Updates member lists
- `workspace-member-updated` â†’ Updates member roles
- `workspace-member-removed` â†’ Removes from member lists

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Implemented

âœ… **Real-time notifications** with toast messages  
âœ… **Persistent notification state** with Zustand  
âœ… **Viewed/unread status** tracking  
âœ… **Socket room management** (user-specific and workspace-specific)  
âœ… **Optimistic UI updates** using React Query cache  
âœ… **Automatic cache synchronization**  
âœ… **Error handling** and fallback mechanisms  
âœ… **Memory efficient** notification cleanup  
âœ… **Cross-component** state synchronization  
âœ… **Backward compatibility** for database fields

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Add `viewed` field to Directus** (see DATABASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
2. **Configure environment variables**
3. **Start all services** (Socket server, Directus, Frontend)
4. **Test the complete workflow**

## ðŸ“‹ Event Testing Checklist

- [ ] Send invitation â†’ Toast appears + dropdown updates
- [ ] Accept invitation â†’ Member added to workspace + notifications cleared
- [ ] Reject invitation â†’ Notifications cleared
- [ ] Cancel invitation â†’ Removed from all UIs
- [ ] Change member role â†’ Updates in real-time
- [ ] Remove member â†’ Updates in real-time
- [ ] Mark as viewed â†’ Counter updates + visual indicators change

The implementation follows the specification document exactly and provides a robust, scalable real-time notification system.
